  abstract = {Winner, Frederick W. Lanchester Prize given by The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS), 1995.During the height of the Cold War, between 1965 and 1968, Robert Aumann, Michael Maschler, and Richard Stearns collaborated on research on the dynamics of arms control negotiations that has since become foundational to work on repeated games. These five seminal papers are collected here for the first time, with the addition of "postscripts" describing many of the developments since the papers were written. The basic model studied throughout the book is one in which players ignorant about the game being played must learn what they can from the actions of the others.The original work, done under contract to the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, was intended to tackle the gradual disarmament problem, in which neither player knew what his own payoff would be for any given agreement, because of uncertainty about the other side's arsenal and weapons production technology. But the research soon became much more generalized, covering information concealment and revelation, signaling and learning, and related ideas in any repeated competitive situation.The first four chapters of the book treat the competitive zero-sum side of the theory of repeated games. Chapter five takes up cooperative phenomena where one player may want to signal information to another. An extensive bibliography covers all items mentioned in the main text, in the postscripts, and in the introduction. The bibliography also includes a compilation of published papers and books that refer to the original reports.},

In this way, all machines can continuously work even though they do not have the latest version of the shared parameter. We prove the convergence of the consistency of this general distributed asynchronous method for gradient iterations then show its efficiency on the matrix factorization problem for recommender systems and on binary classification.},

  abstract = {6LoWPAN technology has attracted extensive attention recently. It is because 6LoWPAN is one of Internet of Things standard and it adapts to IPv6 protocol stack over low-rate wireless personal area network, such as IEEE 802.15.4. One view is that IP architecture is not suitable for low-rate wireless personal area network. It is a challenge to implement the IPv6 protocol stack into IEEE 802.15.4 devices due to that the size of IPv6 packet is much larger than the maximum packet size of IEEE 802.15.4 in data link layer. In order to solve this problem, 6LoWPAN provides header compression to reduce the transmission overhead for IP packets. In addition, two selected routing schemes, mesh-under and route-over routing schemes, are also proposed in 6LoWPAN to forward IP fragmentations under IEEE 802.15.4 radio link. The distinction is based on which layer of the 6LoWPAN protocol stack is in charge of routing decisions. In route-over routing scheme, the routing distinction is taken at the network layer and, in mesh-under, is taken by the adaptation layer. Thus, the goal of this research is to understand the performance of two routing schemes in 6LoWPAN under error-prone channel condition.},

In this paper, we establish a hierarchical model of integrated energy system, which composes of fundamental units such as energy converters, supply networks, and consumers. The fundamental units are modeled as individuals which operate independently and interact with others through mutual information. The fundamental units constitute low-level systems and the combinations of low-level systems make up high-level systems. In order to protect the information privacy of each individual and make full use of the limited mutual information, a decentralized optimization method is presented to optimize the operation strategy of the hierarchical system considering competitive activities between individuals. The individuals participate in an iterative process, interacting with others through an energy pricing mechanism until the system equilibrium achieved. Simulation studies are conducted on several integrated energy systems to investigate the performance of the proposed hierarchical model and decentralized optimization of coordinated electrical and thermal generations. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to a practical case of Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, and the daily operation strategy of the energy supplier is optimized.},

Compared to larger-scale power grid, micro-grid is more difficult to realize the short-term load forecasting for its smaller capacity and higher randomness. A hybrid load forecasting model with parameter optimization is proposed for short-term load forecasting of micro-grids, being composed of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Extreme Learning Machine with Kernel (KELM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Firstly, the time-series load data are decomposed into a number of Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) components through EMD. Two typical different forecasting algorithms (EKF and KELM) are adopted to predict different kinds of IMF components. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the parameters in the model. Considering the limited computation resources, an implementation mode based on off-line parameter optimization, period parameters updating and on-line load forecasting is proposed. Finally, four typical micro-grids with different users and capacities are used to test the accuracy and efficiency of the forecasting model.},

  abstract = {The recent breakthroughs of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique in Alpha Go and playing Atari have set a good example in handling large state and actions spaces of complicated control problems. The DRL technique is comprised of (i) an offline deep neural network (DNN) construction phase, which derives the correlation between each state-action pair of the system and its value function, and (ii) an online deep Q-learning phase, which adaptively derives the optimal action and updates value estimates. In this paper, we first present the general DRL framework, which can be widely utilized in many applications with different optimization objectives. This is followed by the introduction of three specific applications: the cloud computing resource allocation problem, the residential smart grid task scheduling problem, and building HVAC system optimal control problem. The effectiveness of the DRL technique in these three cyber-physical applications have been validated. Finally, this paper investigates the stochastic computing-based hardware implementations of the DRL framework, which consumes a significant improvement in area efficiency and power consumption compared with binary-based implementation counterparts.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of minimizing the difference in the demand and the supply of power using microgrids. We setup multiple microgrids, that provide electricity to a village. They have access to the batteries that can store renewable power and also the electrical lines from the main grid. During each time period, these microgrids need to take decision on the amount of renewable power to be used from the batteries as well as the amount of power needed from the main grid. We formulate this problem in the framework of Markov Decision Process (MDP), similar to the one discussed in [1]. The power allotment to the village from the main grid is fixed and bounded, whereas the renewable energy generation is uncertain in nature. Therefore we adapt a distributed version of the popular Reinforcement learning technique, Multi-Agent Q-Learning to the problem. Finally, we also consider a variant of this problem where the cost of power production at the main site is taken into consideration. In this scenario the microgrids need to minimize the demand-supply deficit, while maintaining the desired average cost of the power production.},

State history, and the ability to rollback the simulation, can provide unique functionality for human-in-the-loop simulation environments. This paper investigates the use of Time Warp to output valid simulation state in a near real-time manner, re-execute portions of the simulation, and interactively probe simulation values to ascertain underlying causes of transient behavior. A shared-memory, multi-threaded interactive simulation architecture is presented and the additional state saving requirements imposed by interactivity are examined. The shortcomings of existing state saving schemes lead us to propose multiplexed state saving (MSS). By interleaving check-pointing and incremental state logs MSS provides bounded rollback costs and asynchronous access to prior simulation state. The interaction algorithms and MSS form a scalable, bounded cost component suitable for use in a real-time interactive Time Warp system},

The experimental results show that our prototype system improves the performance of Avrora by 2 to 10 times for typical network-centric sensor network applications, and up to three orders of magnitude for applications that use the radio infrequently. We also implement a distributed version of SnapSim, D-SnapSim, which runs on a cluster.

Where the entities of a physical system execute independently and interact asynchronously, an asynchronous distributed event-driven simulation algorithm may enable the simulation of the system to execute on a parallel processor. This has the potential to significantly reduce the total simulation time. YADDES is the first algorithm that is characterized by: (1) acceptable performance, (2) freedom from deadlock, and (3) probably correct, for circuits where the interactions between the entities constitute a cyclic dependence. Given their complex, asynchronous nature, an important issue associated with all asynchronous distributed algorithms is their correctness, i.e., the generation of accurate output for given input stimulus, under all possible conditions. This paper presents a mathematical proof of correctness and reports the performance of YADDES on the Armstrong parallel processor at Brown University},

As more and more Internet of Things (IoT) devices with measurement and/or control capability are designed and deployed for a more stable and efficient power system, the role of communication network has become more important. To evaluate the performance of control algorithms for inter-dependent power grid and communication network, a test bed that could simulate inter-dependent power grid and communication network is desirable. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and implementation of a novel co-simulator, which would effectively evaluate IoT-aided algorithms for scheduling the jobs of electrical appliances. There are three major features of our co-simulator: 1) large-scale test is achieved by distributed modules that are designed based on a Turing-indistinguishable approach; 2) remote servers or test devices are controlled by local graphical user interface (we only need to configure the simulator on a local server); 3) a software virtual network approach is employed to emulate real networks, which significantly reduces the cost of real-world test beds. To evaluate our co-simulator, two energy consumption scheduling algorithms are implemented. Experimental results show that our co-simulator could effectively evaluate these methods. Thus our co-simulator is a powerful tool for utility companies and policy makers to commission novel IoT devices or methods in future smart grid infrastructure.},

  title = {Power System and Communication Network Co-Simulation for Smart Grid Applications},
  abstract = {The vision of a smart grid is predicated upon pervasive use of modern digital communication techniques to today's power system. As wide area measurements and control techniques are being developed and deployed for a more resilient power system, the role of communication network is becoming prominent. Power system dynamics gets influenced by the communication delays in the network. Therefore, extensive integration of power system and its communication infrastructure mandates that the two systems are studied as a single distributed cyber-physical system. This paper proposes a power/network co-simulation framework which integrates power system dynamic simulator and network simulator together using an accurate synchronization mechanism. The accuracy is tunable based on the time-scale requirements of the phenomena being studied. This co-simulation can improve the practical investigation of smart grid and evaluate wide area measurement and control schemes. As a case study an agent-based remote backup relay system is simulated and validated on this co-simulation framework.},

The comprehensive study includes the analysis of the statistics of the path-loss profile, the average channel gain, the root-mean-square delay spread, and the channel capacity. We highlight the dependency on topological information as the network layout area, the intensity of outlets, the backbone length, etc. We furthermore propose a channel classification based either on average capacity or topological information (e.g., the belonging of outlets to rooms served by the same derivation box). We show that the developed channel simulator constitutes a powerful theoretical framework for the generation and analysis of statistically representative channels with a strong connection to physical reality and close match to the results obtained in the measurements campaigns.},

It is then applied to the study of an access architecture based on leased lines from local broadband access providers. This permits consideration of the potential starvation of domestic traffic, which is avoided by applying well-known traffic management techniques. From previous results obtained for a purpose-built WiMAX SGLM network, the intuition that a leased broadband access yields lower latencies is verified.

In 2014, G3-PLC standard proposed the LOADng protocol to perform the routing. In this work, we analysed the performance of this protocol in PLC topologies. For that purpose, we developed our own simulator in the Contiki/Cooja platform in which we have implemented the LOADng protocol as well as the different features of G3-PLC networks. Based on our tool, we studied the impact of the average number of neighbours that a node can reach (i.e., the effect of the node density). In particular, we report the results we obtained for different node densities and for different link qualities. These results highlight that it exists an optimal average number of neighbours for which the performance are improved.},

Many previous works have made implicit or explicit assumptions that lead to simplified modeling and simulation of the underlying communication systems. While these assumptions are valid under some cases, they may not hold true when system size and complexity scale up exponentially, which can be anticipated given the rapid development of smart grid technologies. In this paper, we present a more comprehensive modeling and simulation approach that accounts for the MAS related protocols as described in the FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) specification; together with a co-simulation platform for the investigation of multi-disciplinary interdependencies between MAS, communication, and electrical systems. To show the benefits of comprehensive modeling and simulation, we demonstrate how different network configurations affect system performance in a Fault Location, Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR) scenario.},

  abstract = {Cognitive radio based smart grid communication allows smart grid users to utilize spectrum bands opportunistically. Cognitive radio does not require spectrum leasing cost, saves users' energy consumption, keeps interference level low, and improves interoperability. In low traffic load environment, cognitive radio is able to support smart grid data transmission. However, the traffic load in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) can be as high as 1000 kbps or 500 kbps for backhaul. In this paper, the performance of cognitive radio in high traffic load AMI is investigated. Iterative Water Filling Algorithm (IWFA) is implemented upon cognitive radio to maximize the capacity of smart grid users through computing optimal transmit power for each user. The performances of sequential IWFA and asynchronous IWFA in smart grid communication are investigated. Simulation is conducted using Network Simulator 2. Simulation results show that IWFA indeed is able to maximize the capacity of smart grid users. Results also show that the asynchronous IWFA performs better than sequential IWFA. Asynchronous IWFA improves delivery ratio and throughput of cognitive radio based AMI communication by 5.95\% and 8.67\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {The use of distributed computation and control is pervasive for a wide range of smart grid research topics. However, recent developments of smart grid co-simulation platforms have not been able to provide effective support for the modeling and simulation of distributed software systems. In particular, cosimulation literatures only focused on the integration of electrical and communication network simulators, and the responsibility for modeling distributed software is often delegated to one of these two simulators. Since these domain specific simulators are not designed for this purpose, such delegation incurs many limitations that prevent convenient, effective, and accurate modeling of software behaviors. To mitigate the problem, this paper presents, to our knowledge, the first co-simulation integration of direct-execution simulators to provide dedicated support for distributed smart grid software. We first present the development of the novel DecompositionJ framework (DEterministic, COncurrent Multi-PrOcessing SImulaTION for Java programs), which is a compiler-based code analyzer and transformer to automatically convert multi-thread Java programs into direct-execution simulators, eliminating the need for manual code or model development. Next, we apply DecompositionJ framework to generate simulators for a popular multi-agent platform JADE. The JADE simulators are then integrated with electromagnetic transient simulator (PSCAD) and packet-level network simulator (OPNET) using standardized co-simulation runtime infrastructure. At last, we conduct a case study on agent-based smart grid restoration using this novel co-simulation platform. Through the analysis of simulation results, it is shown that the proposed direct-execution simulation framework is able to facilitate the understanding, evaluation, and debugging of distributed smart grid software.},

  abstract = {Critical Infrastructures (CI) are vulnerable to potentially catastrophic failures on many levels, especially when cascading disablements have escalating impacts across multiple connected infrastructures. In responding to outages, such cross-infrastructure effects can make analysis for decision makers and responders far more complex. To facilitate recovery in the dynamic context of such scenarios, decision makers need to utilize specialized decision support tools to assist in prioritizing alternatives. We have developed a recommender system based framework for CI decision support, focused on CI recovery. It models impacts of infrastructure elements, both within and across infrastructures, in order to recommend focus areas for reconstitution resources. Our system utilizes an interactive geovisualization interface to provide a natural context for infrastructure analysis support. This paper presents a user study evaluation of our approach, comparing its effectiveness to standard GIS tools that are used for CI analysis. Results show that our approach improves interaction quality and efficiency, as well as reducing cognitive load.},

  abstract = {In smart grid research domain, simulation study is the first choice, since the analytic complexity is too high and constructing a testbed is very expensive. However, since communication infrastructure and the power grid are tightly coupled with each other in the smart grid, a well-defined combination of simulation tools for the systems is required for the simulation study. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a cosimulation work called OOCoSim, which consists of OPNET (network simulation tool) and OpenDSS (power system simulation tool). By employing the simulation tool, an organic and dynamic cosimulation can be realized since both simulators operate on the same computing platform and provide external interfaces through which the simulation can be managed dynamically. In this paper, we provide OOCoSim design principles including a synchronization scheme and detailed descriptions of its implementation. To present the effectiveness of OOCoSim, we define a smart grid application model and conduct a simulation study to see the impact of the defined application and the underlying network system on the distribution system. The simulation results show that the proposed OOCoSim can successfully simulate the integrated scenario of the power and network systems and produce the accurate effects of the networked control in the smart grid.},

We present efficient designs for both the transmit power allocation and the coefficients of the surface reflecting elements that target at maximizing either the energy or the spectral efficiency subject to individual link budget guarantees for the mobile users. Since both problem formulations are non-convex, we propose two computationally affordable approaches, which both capitalize on alternating maximization. To tackle the more demanding energy efficiency problem, we present an algorithm based on gradient descent for obtaining the LIS phase coefficients, while the optimal transmit power allocation is provided by a fractional programming method. For the energy efficiency maximizing LIS tuning, we also propose an efficient algorithm based on the majorization-minimization approach. Computer simulation results under a realistic outdoor system set up and power consumption model for LIS are presented, where LIS-assisted communication is extensively compared with the case of multi-antenna amplify-and-forward relaying. The results corroborate the merits of LIS incorporation using both our proposed design algorithms, and as it is shown that LIS-assisted communication can provide up to 300\% higher energy efficiency than the conventional relay-assisted one.},

In a first step, we derive Fisher-information and Cram\textbackslash{}'\{e\}r-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) in closed-form for positioning a terminal located perpendicular to the center of the LIS, whose location we refer to as being on the central perpendicular line (CPL) of the LIS. For a terminal that is not on the CPL, closed-form expressions of the Fisher-information and CRLB seem out of reach, and we alternatively find approximations of them which are shown to be accurate. Under mild conditions, we show that the CRLB for all three Cartesian dimensions (\$x\$, \$y\$ and \$z\$) decreases quadratically in the surface-area of the LIS, except for a terminal exactly on the CPL where the CRLB for the \$z\$-dimension (distance from the LIS) decreases linearly in the same. In a second step, we analyze the CRLB for positioning when there is an unknown phase \$\textbackslash{}varphi\$ presented in the analog circuits of the LIS. We then show that the CRLBs are dramatically increased for all three dimensions but decrease in the third-order of the surface-area. Moreover, with an infinitely large LIS the CRLB for the \$z\$-dimension with an unknown \$\textbackslash{}varphi\$ is 6 dB higher than the case without phase uncertainty, and the CRLB for estimating \$\textbackslash{}varphi\$ converges to a constant that is independent of the wavelength \$\textbackslash{}lambda\$. At last, we extensively discuss the impact of centralized and distributed deployments of LIS, and show that a distributed deployment of LIS can enlarge the coverage for terminal-positioning and improve the overall positioning performance.},

Computational advances have made possible a growing number of agent-based models across a variety of application domains. Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market, supply chains, and consumer markets, to predicting the spread of epidemics, mitigating the threat of bio-warfare, and understanding the factors that may be responsible for the fall of ancient civilizations. Such progress suggests the potential of ABMS to have far-reaching effects on the way that businesses use computers to support decision-making and researchers use agent-based models as electronic laboratories. Some contend that ABMS ``is a third way of doing science'' and could augment traditional deductive and inductive reasoning as discovery methods. This brief tutorial introduces agent-based modeling by describing the foundations of ABMS, discussing some illustrative applications, and addressing toolkits and methods for developing agent-based models.},

  abstract = {In cognitive radio, spectrum sensing is used to find the white spectrum or protect the primary user from interference caused by the secondary user (SU). There are two conventional spectrum sensing approaches: quiet and active. However, these conventional approaches have several problems. In quiet sensing, the quiet period degrades the SU capacity. With active sensing, the SU capacity is also degraded by the need for additional resource consumption and the mismatch in feedback information. In order to mitigate these problems, the structure of simultaneous PU sensing and data transmission is introduced. This structure is equipped with antenna isolation and self-interference cancellation in which the communication and the sensing radios are already assumed to be significantly isolated. This approach is designed so that the SU transmitter can sense PU signals and transmit data signals at the same time by dividing its spatial resources. Expanding on this work, we propose a concept of "TranSensing" which adaptively uses spatial resource according to the surrounding environments. To effectively use TranSensing, we propose a two-stage algorithm (TSA). Finally, the impact of residual interference on TranSensing is investigated. Simulation results show that TranSensing with TSA enhances the SU capacity over the conventional quiet or active sensing.},

At the same time, the CRN software framework should provide interfaces with hardware platforms for testbed evaluation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL). Unfortunately, there is no such software framework in the research community. This paper studies the combination of some open-source frameworks for high fidelity simulation of CRN. In particular, some challenges are highlighted for the combination of radio simulators (e.g. GNU Radio, CogWave) and network simulators (e.g. OMNeT++, ns-3) at the level of network layer, data link layer and physical layer. Based on this evaluation, new extensions to the CogWave open-source software framework are proposed for high fidelity simulation of CRN.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a MAC-PHY cross-layer analysis of a narrow-band power line communication (NB-PLC) system in the presence of impulsive noise. We consider a CSMA/CA based MAC layer along with the impulsive noise in PHY layer modeled as a Bernoulli-Gaussian process. We calculate the bit error rate (BER) for such an NB-PLC system with two-level amplitude-shift keying (ASK), binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), and binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK) as the signaling schemes. This BER is then incorporated in MAC layer to analyse throughout, reliability, and average wait time performances. From numerical results, it shown that for a fixed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the MAC layer performance degrades with increasing average occurrence of impulsive noise. Further, for a fixed SNR, the superiority of the BPSK is shown over ASK and BFSK. It is also shown that for a fixed SNR the throughput decreases with increasing number of devices. Hence, we motivate a redesign of the MAC layer protocol for NB-PLC network to handle a large number of devices.},

  abstract = {We consider single-hop topologies with saturated transmitting nodes, using carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance CSMA/CA for medium access, as standardized under the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function. We study systems where one or more backoff parameters of the CSMA/CA protocol the initial backoff, the backoff multiplier, and the number of retries are different from the standard. It is known that, for several classes of these protocol parameters, such systems exhibit a certain performance anomaly known as short term unfairness. We also find that the phenomenon of short term unfairness is observed in systems where the propagation delays among the participating nodes are not negligible compared with the duration of a backoff slot, even when the nodes use the default backoff parameters of the standard. It also turns out that the standard fixed point analysis technique and its simple extensions does not predict the system behavior well in such cases. For systems with large propagation delays, we observe that, as propagation delay increases, the collision probability of a node initially increases, but then flattens out, contrary to what is predicted by the standard fixed point approximation. Our study of several example systems reveals some interesting connections between the protocol parameters, the number of nodes, the propagation delay, and the degree of unfairness. This paper reveals that the inability of the standard fixed point model to capture the performance in such cases is due to its state-independent attempt rate assumption. In this paper, we develop a novel approximate, but accurate, analysis that uses state-dependent attempt rates with a parsimonious state representation for computational tractability. The analytical method is also able to quantify the extent of short term unfairness in the system, something not possible with existing analytical techniques, and can, therefore, be used to tune the protocol parameters to achieve desired throughput and fairness objectives.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel concept of three-dimensional (3D) cellular networks, that integrate drone base stations (drone-BS) and cellular-connected drone users (drone-UEs), is introduced. For this new 3D cellular architecture, a novel framework for network planning for drone-BSs as well as latency-minimal cell association for drone-UEs is proposed. For network planning, a tractable method for drone-BSs' deployment based on the notion of truncated octahedron shapes is proposed that ensures full coverage for a given space with minimum number of drone-BSs. In addition, to characterize frequency planning in such 3D wireless networks, an analytical expression for the feasible integer frequency reuse factors is derived. Subsequently, an optimal 3D cell association scheme is developed for which the drone-UEs' latency, considering transmission, computation, and backhaul delays, is minimized. To this end, first, the spatial distribution of the drone-UEs is estimated using a kernel density estimation method, and the parameters of the estimator are obtained using a cross-validation method. Then, according to the spatial distribution of drone-UEs and the locations of drone-BSs, the latency-minimal 3D cell association for drone-UEs is derived by exploiting tools from optimal transport theory. Simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the latency of drone-UEs compared to the classical cell association approach that uses a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion. In particular, the proposed approach yields a reduction of up to 46\% in the average latency compared to the SINR-based association. The results also show that the proposed latency-optimal cell association improves the spectral efficiency of a 3D wireless cellular network of drones.},

  abstract = {Complex networks have been studied intensively for a decade, but research still focuses on the limited case of a single, non-interacting network1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Modern systems are coupled together15,16,17,18,19 and therefore should be modelled as interdependent networks. A fundamental property of interdependent networks is that failure of nodes in one network may lead to failure of dependent nodes in other networks. This may happen recursively and can lead to a cascade of failures. In fact, a failure of a very small fraction of nodes in one network may lead to the complete fragmentation of a system of several interdependent networks. A dramatic real-world example of a cascade of failures (`concurrent malfunction') is the electrical blackout that affected much of Italy on 28 September 2003: the shutdown of power stations directly led to the failure of nodes in the Internet communication network, which in turn caused further breakdown of power stations20. Here we develop a framework for understanding the robustness of interacting networks subject to such cascading failures. We present exact analytical solutions for the critical fraction of nodes that, on removal, will lead to a failure cascade and to a complete fragmentation of two interdependent networks. Surprisingly, a broader degree distribution increases the vulnerability of interdependent networks to random failure, which is opposite to how a single network behaves. Our findings highlight the need to consider interdependent network properties in designing robust networks.},

We use a standard approach for predicting the load in the next 10 min, while, for a forecast horizon of one day, we represent the data with a high-dimensional multi-variate TS, where the number of variables is equivalent to the quantity of measurements registered in a day. Through the orthogonal transformation returned by PCA decomposition, we reduce the dimensionality of the TS to a lower number k of distinct variables; this allows us to cast the original prediction problem in k different one-step ahead predictions. The overall forecast can be effectively managed by k distinct prediction models, whose outputs are combined together to obtain the final result. We employ a genetic algorithm for tuning the parameters of the ESN and compare its prediction accuracy with a standard autoregressive integrated moving average model.},

To this aim, we investigate the application of a number of predictive models for time-series, including methods based on empirical strategies frequently adopted in the smart grid community, Kalman Filters and Echo State Networks (ESNs). The considered methods have been suitably modified to address the electricity price forecast problem. Strategies based on daily re-adaptation of models' parameters are taken into consideration as well. The predictive performance achieved by the considered models is assessed, and the methods are compared among each other on recent real data from the Italian electricity market. As a result of the comparison over three years data, ESN methods appear to provide the most accurate price predictions, which could imply significant economic savings in many smart grid activities, such as switching on power plants to support power generation from renewable sources, electric vehicle recharging or usage of household appliances.},

When time is discrete and only the relationships between the participating entities may change and not the entities themselves, a temporal graph may be viewed as a sequence \$G\_1,G\_2\textbackslash{}ldots,G\_l\$ of static graphs over the same (static) set of nodes \$V\$. Though static graphs have been extensively studied, for their temporal generalization we are still far from having a concrete set of structural and algorithmic principles. Recent research shows that many graph properties and problems become radically different and usually substantially more difficult when an extra time dimension in added to them. Moreover, there is already a rich and rapidly growing set of modern systems and applications that can be naturally modeled and studied via temporal graphs. This, further motivates the need for the development of a temporal extension of graph theory. We survey here recent results on temporal graphs and temporal graph problems that have appeared in the Computer Science community.},

Indeed, the concepts discovered in these investigations can be viewed as parts of the same conceptual universe, and the formal models proposed so far to express some specific concepts are the components of a larger formal description of this universe. The main contribution of this paper is to integrate the vast collection of concepts, formalisms and results found in the literature into a unified framework, which we call time-varying graphs (TVGs). Using this framework, it is possible to express directly in the same formalism not only the concepts common to all those different areas, but also those specific to each. Based on this definitional work, employing both existing results and original observations, we present a hierarchical classification of TVGs; each class corresponds to a significant property examined in the distributed computing literature. We then examine how TVGs can be used to study the evolution of network properties, and propose different techniques, depending on whether the indicators for these properties are atemporal (as in the majority of existing studies) or temporal. Finally, we briefly discuss the introduction of randomness in TVGs.},

A simplified co-simulation model is then put forth for analyzing the interdependencies between energy and information flows, and obtaining the quantitative relation between information features and power system operations. As the operational characteristics of a cyber system can be entirely captured by all end-to-end information flows, our developed model is hence termed as the information flow based co-simulation model. The information flow based model features in low complexity and covering potential cyber contingencies. Moreover, the quantitative relation can provide requirements for the planning and operation of cyber systems. To illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model, a comparison with the commercial communication simulation software OPNET is made. Finally, a wide-area damping control application is taken as an example to demonstrate physical impacts of various cyber-contingencies.},

MicroGrids have emerged as a promising solution to the integration problem and have duly received increasing research attention. Microgrids are semi-autonomous collections of controllable microsources and loads, which present themselves to the utility grid as single, controlled entities. In order to achieve the semi-autonomous and controlled nature of microgrids, especially,overcoming the challenge of balancing demand and power generation, an intelligent energy management scheme is required.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Developing an energy management scheme is an interesting and challenging task, which provides the potential to exploit ideas from a plethora of fields like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Constrained Optimization, etc. However, testing energy management strategies on a microgrid would pose a multitude of problems,the most important of them being the unreliability and inconvenience of testing an energy management strategy, which is not optimal, on a functional microgrid. Errors in a test strategy might cause power outages and damage installed devices. Hence it is necessary to test energy management strategies on simulated microgrids.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This thesis presents a Software Testbed of MicroGrids, specifically designed to suit the purposes of development of energy management strategies. The testbed consists of two components: Simulation Framework and Analysis Tool. The modular simulation framework enables simulation of a microgrid with microsources and loads,whose configurations can be specified by the user. The analysis tool enables visual analysis of data generated using simulations, which would enable the improvement of not only the management strategy and prediction techniques, but also the computer models used in the simulation framework. A demonstration of the software testbed's simulation and analysis capabilities is presented and possible directions for future research are suggested.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

For example, voltage variation might trigger protection devices and disconnect DERs within the MG. Centrally controlled MGs (CCMGs) type is dependent on communication. Therefore, it is very important to analyze the impact of communication networks performance degradation, such as latency, on the bus voltage of CCMGs. This paper investigates the effect of wireless communication technologies latency on the bus voltage and performance of centralized DC MGs. Two mathematical models were developed to describe the behavior of microgrids during latency. As a case study, a renewable energy- based DC microgrid with its centralized control scheme was simulated to validate and compare the developed mathematical models. Results verify the accuracy of the developed models and show that the impact may be severe depending on the design, and the operational condition of the MG before latency occurs.},

It is increasingly used in power and energy systems for both academic research and industrial applications. Due to the evolution of the computing power of RT simulators in recent years, new classes of applications and expanded fields of practice could now be addressed with RT simulation. This increase in computation power implies that models can be built more accurately and the whole simulation system gets closer to reality. This Task Force paper summarizes various applications of digital RT simulation technologies in the design, analysis, and testing of power and energy systems.},

  abstract = {Consensus is well accepted as being a fundamental paradigm for coordination of groups of autonomous agents. Recently, we casted previous work on multi-agent consensus protocols into an asynchronous framework, where each agent updates on its own pace, and uses the most recently received information from other agents. Asynchronous consensus protocols encompass those synchronous ones with various communication patterns. In this paper, we study via simulation a number of open new problems introduced by the asynchronous operation of multi-agent systems. More interestingly, the existing consensus results are classified by their communication assumptions and future research directions are proposed. To facilitate our study, we develop a multi-vehicle simulator in Java, built on top of JProwler; JProwler is a discrete event simulator for prototyping, verifying and analyzing communication protocols of ad-hoc wireless networks. Implementation issues with their implications are also discussed.},

Reflecting the goals of the Special Issue itself, this paper surveys relevant work from the areas of systems and control, signal processing, detection and estimation, data fusion, and distributed systems. We discuss appropriate network architectures, topics such as coding for robustly stable control in the presence of time-varying channel capacity, channels with fixed versus adaptively variable data width, issues in data rate problems in nonlinear feedback problems, and problems in routing for stability and performance. In surveying current research on networked control systems, we find that recent theoretical advances and target applications are intimately intertwined. The common goal of papers in the Special Issue which follows is to describe key aspects of this relationship. We also aim to provide a bridge between networked control systems and closely related contemporary work dealing with sensor networks and wireless communication protocols.},

  abstract = {The integration of distributed renewable energy sources and the multi-domain behaviours inside the cyberphysical energy system (smart grids) draws up major challenges. Their validation and roll out requires careful assessment, in term of modelling, simulation and testing. The traditional approach focusing on a particular object, actual hardware or a detailed model, while drastically simplifying the remainder of the system under test, is no longer sufficient. Real-time simulation and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) techniques emerge as indispensable tools for validating the behaviour of renewable sources as well as their impact/interaction to with the cyber-physical energy system. This paper aims to provide an overview of the present status-quo of real-time and HIL approaches used for smart grids and their readiness for cyber-physical experiments. We investigate the current limitations of HIL techniques and point out necessary future developments. Subsequently, the paper highlights challenges that need specific attention as well as ongoing actions and further research directions.},

  shorttitle = {T-{{RECS}}},
  abstract = {In real-time control of electric grids using multiple software agents, the control performance depends on (1) the proper functioning of the software agents, i.e., absence of software faults, and (2) the behavior of software agents in the presence of non-ideal communication networks such as message losses and delays. To evaluate the control performance of such systems, we propose T-RECS, a virtual commissioning tool. T-RECS enables testing the performance of software-based control in-silico (before the actual deployment of software agents in the grid), saving both time and money. Developers can run the binaries of their software agents in T-RECS where these binaries exchange real messages by using an emulated network and simulated models of the electric grid and resources. Consequently, the control of an entire microgrid can be tested on a standard computer. In this paper, we first describe the design and the open-source implementation of T-RECS. Second, we measure its CPU and memory usage and show that our implementation can accommodate eight software agents on a standard laptop computer. Third, we validate the simulated grid used in T-RECS by replaying data collected from experiments performed in a real low-voltage microgrid. We find that the average error is 0.037\% and the 99th percentile of the error is less than 0.1\%. Finally, we present some typical use-cases of T-RECS such as performance evaluation (1) under extreme grid conditions and (2) with non-ideal communication networks. The former, i.e., performance evaluation under extreme grid conditions, is difficult to test in the field due to safety concerns.

The optimization engine receives the AMI data stream through measurement aggregators.

To check the performance and the precision of proposed VVO, a fault scenario is imposed upon the system. IEC 61850 GOOSE messages are generated and sent to change the status of specified breakers, while the VVO engine receives system reconfiguration commands via IEC61850 Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) protocol.

One of the most distinguished challenges in studying the aftermath of cyber attacks in smart grid lies in \emph{data-centric} threats. Even though such attacks are critical to the information network, they will result in much more Domino-like impact than they behave in cyber world. This is because for an information-centric network, distorted or delayed information undermines services and applications. But in power grid, these data-centric attacks may result in instable power systems, and further detrimental impact of power supplies. In this paper, we present Greenbench, a benchmark that is designed to evaluate real-time power grid dynamics in response to data-centric attacks. The simulation results provide several counter-intuitive suggestions to both smart grid security research and deployment.},

  abstract = {This paper describes GridSpice, a scalable open-source simulation framework for modeling, designing, and planning of the smart grid. GridSpice seamlessly integrates existing electric power simulation tools to enable modeling of large electric networks that blur the boundaries between generation, transmission, distribution, and markets. This is achieved via a cloud-based architecture that allows for parallelizing large simulation jobs across many virtual machines using a pay-as-you-go model. GridSpice simulations can be managed through a Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API), or through a Python library, allowing users to run simulations programmatically and interface with disparate data inputs, energy management systems (EMS), distribution management systems (DMS), and postprocessing tools. These capabilities make GridSpice an ideal tool for the development and testing of new grid control and optimization algorithms. GridSpice also provides an easy-to-use browser-based interface to allow novice users to begin without any setup or configuration on their local PC. A first implementation of the GridSpice framework integrates Gridlab-D and MATPOWER as simulation tools, and has been used for projects including optimizing the placement of distributed generation and developing optimal dispatch schedules for flexible loads. The GridSpice framework and Gridlab-D are freely available in open-source under the BSD license.},

As wide area measurements and control techniques are being developed and deployed for a more resilient power system, the role of communication network is becoming prominent. Power system dynamics gets influenced by the communication delays in the network. Therefore, extensive integration of power system and communication infrastructure mandates that the two systems be studied as a single distributed cyber-physical system. This paper proposes a power system and communication network co-simulation framework (GECO) using a global event-driven mechanism. The accuracy is tunable based on the time-scale requirements of the phenomena being studied. This co-simulation can improve the practical investigation of smart grid and evaluate wide area measurement and control schemes. As a case study, a communication-based backup distance relay protection scheme is co-simulated and validated on this co-simulation framework.},

  abstract = {The use of distributed computation and control is pervasive for a wide range of smart grid research topics. However, recent developments of smart grid co-simulation platforms have not been able to provide effective support for the modeling and simulation of distributed software systems. In particular, cosimulation literatures only focused on the integration of electrical and communication network simulators, and the responsibility for modeling distributed software is often delegated to one of these two simulators. Since these domain specific simulators are not designed for this purpose, such delegation incurs many limitations that prevent convenient, effective, and accurate modeling of software behaviors. To mitigate the problem, this paper presents, to our knowledge, the first co-simulation integration of direct-execution simulators to provide dedicated support for distributed smart grid software. We first present the development of the novel DecompositionJ framework (DEterministic, COncurrent Multi-PrOcessing SImulaTION for Java programs), which is a compiler-based code analyzer and transformer to automatically convert multi-thread Java programs into direct-execution simulators, eliminating the need for manual code or model development. Next, we apply DecompositionJ framework to generate simulators for a popular multi-agent platform JADE. The JADE simulators are then integrated with electromagnetic transient simulator (PSCAD) and packet-level network simulator (OPNET) using standardized co-simulation runtime infrastructure. At last, we conduct a case study on agent-based smart grid restoration using this novel co-simulation platform. Through the analysis of simulation results, it is shown that the proposed direct-execution simulation framework is able to facilitate the understanding, evaluation, and debugging of distributed smart grid software.},

  abstract = {The conventional approach for the control of distribution networks, in the presence of active generation and/or controllable loads and storage, involves a combination of both frequency and voltage regulation at different time scales. With the increased penetration of stochastic resources, distributed generation and demand response, this approach shows severe limitations in both the optimal and feasible operation of these networks, as well as in the aggregation of the network resources for upper-layer power systems. An alternative approach is to directly control the targeted grid by defining explicit and real-time setpoints for active/reactive power absorptions/injections defined by a solution of a specific optimization problem; but this quickly becomes intractable when systems get large or diverse. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a method for the explicit control of the grid status, based on a common abstract model characterized by the main property of being composable. That is to say, subsystems can be aggregated into virtual devices that hide their internal complexity. Thus the proposed method can easily cope with systems of any size or complexity. The framework is presented in this Part I, whilst in Part II we illustrate its application to a CIGR{\'E} low voltage benchmark microgrid. In particular, we provide implementation examples with respect to typical devices connected to distribution networks and evaluate of the performance and benefits of the proposed control framework.},

The metrics of interest are: quality-of-service of the network represented by voltages magnitudes and lines current magnitudes in comparison with their operational boundaries; state-of-charge of electric and thermal storage devices; proportion of curtailed renewables; and propensity of microgrid collapse in the case of renewables overproduction. We compare our method to two classic ones relying on droop control: the first one with only primary control on both frequency and voltage and the second one with an additional secondary frequency control operated by the slack device. We find that our method is able to indirectly control the reserve of the storage systems connected to the microgrid, thus maximizing the autonomy in the islanded operation and, at the same time, reducing renewables curtailment. Moreover, the proposed control framework keeps the system in feasible operation conditions, better explores the various degrees of freedom of the whole system and connected devices, and prevents its collapse in case of extreme operation of stochastic resources. All of these properties are obtained with a simple and generic control framework that supports aggregation and composability.},

Smart grids are an example of cyber physical system (CPS) and an extremely critical infrastructure. The smart grids are expected to be more secure and must have the ability of self-healing and recovery. Smart power grids are also one of the major targets for different kinds of cyber attacks, as they are now an open system network, according to the model architecture of smart power grid. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on understanding the smart power grid, its important components, different cyber security and other kinds of issues, existing methodologies and approaches for communication protocols, and architecture of smart power grids. We conclude our paper by discussing various research challenges that still exist in the literature, which provides a better understanding of the problem, the current solution space, and future research directions to defend smart power against different cyber attacks.},

The starting point has been the IMC PID tuning rules of Rivera, Morari and Skogestad (1986) which have achieved widespread industrial acceptance. The integral term has been modified to improve disturbance rejection for integrating processes. Furthermore, rather than deriving separate rules for each transfer function model, we start by approximating the process by a first-order plus delay processes (using the ``half method''), and then use a single tuning rule. This is much simpler and appears to give controller tunings with comparable performance. All the tunings are derived analytically and are thus very suitable for teaching.},

Different educational, research and industrial efforts have been set to tackle the co-simulation topic from several perspectives. The majority of previous works has addressed the standardization of models and interfaces for data exchange, automation of simulation, as well as improving performance and accuracy of co-simulation setups. Furthermore, the domains of interest so far have involved communication, control, markets and the environment in addition to physical energy systems. However, the current characteristics and state of co-simulation testbeds need to be re-evaluated for future research demands. These demands vary from new domains of interest, such as human and social behavior models, to new applications of co-simulation, such as holistic prognosis and system planning.

  abstract = {Most modeling and simulation (M\&S) questions about complex systems require to take simultaneously account of several points of view. Phenomena evolving at different scales and at different levels of resolution have to be considered. Moreover, expert skills belonging to different scientific fields are needed. The challenges are then to reconcile these heterogeneous points of view, and to integrate each domain tools (formalisms and simulation software) within the rigorous framework of the M\&S process. To answer to this issue, we propose here the specifications of the MECSYCO co-simulation middleware. MECSYCO relies on the universality of the DEVS formalism in order to integrate models written in different formalism. This integration is based on a wrapping strategy in order to make models implemented in different simulation software inter-operable. The middleware performs the co-simulation in a parallel, decentralized and distributable fashion thanks to its modular multi-agent architecture. We detail how MECSYCO perform hybrid co-simulations by integrating in a generic way already implemented continuous models thanks to the FMI standard, the DEV\&DESS formalism and the QSS method. The DEVS wrapping of FMI that we propose is not restricted to MECSYCO but can be performed in any DEVS-based platform. We show the modularity and the genericity of our approach through an iterative smart heating system M\&S. Compared to other works in the literature, our proposition is generic thanks to the strong foundation of DEVS and the unifying features of the FMI standard, while being fully specified from the concepts to their implementations .},

  title = {Real Time Active Power Control in Smart Grid},
  abstract = {A power balance between supply and demand is essential for reliable and stable operation of power grids. The mismatch between supply and demand causes the frequency deviations which results in malfunction of most of the electrical devices. Moreover, it affects the system stability resulting in system blackouts as that of USA, in 2003. For decades the balancing of supply and demand was based on generation side control of power systems through ahead of time generation dispatch scheduling. The smart grid is being used today to describe technologies and methods that automatically and rapidly isolate faults, restore power, monitor demand, and maintain and restore stability for more reliable electric power. Thus, in this study, a method of controlling active power (balancing demand and supply) in real time is proposed This method is feasible in smart grid as communication and advanced information technologies are used for real time data exchange about the generation, demand, storage, market, environmental conditions, and other necessary data. These data are important in making decisions about real-time supply and demand balancing in the smart grid. Additionally, in smart grid, taking the advantage of demand response and storage systems, it is possible to balance demand and supply in real-time The simulation is done by the DigSilent Power Factory simulation tool for verification of the proposed method. In addition to an electric network modeling part of the simulation tool, the DigSilent Programming Language (DPL) feature is used for coding the decision making program.},

This method evolves naturally for calculation of pressures when hydraulic pipelines are modelled with distributed parameters. It is also applicable to other physical systems, such as mechanical, electrical, gas etc. One interesting application for distributed solvers using bi-lateral delay lines is in real time simulation. Modelling for real-time applications puts special requirements on robustness in the numerical methods used. In real-time applications there is no room for decreasing time step in numerically critical stages. Furthermore, if a system is relaying on a realtime simulation for its functionality, failure in the numerical properties is unacceptable..},

Interconnectivity between programs makes it possible to model each part of a complex system with the best suited tool, which will shorten the modelling time and increase the accuracy of the results. Because the system will be naturally partitioned, it is possible to identify weak links and replace them with transmission line elements, thereby introducing a controlled time delay. This makes the different parts of the system naturally independent, making it possible to simulate large aggregated system models with good performance on multi-core processors. The proposed method is demonstrated on an example model. A suggestion of an XML extension to the FMI standard for describing TLM ports is also presented.},

The possible speedups from parallelism are however often limited with the current centralized solver algorithms, which are commonly used in today's simulation environments. An alternative method investigated in this work utilizes distributed solver algorithms using the transmission line modeling (TLM) method. Creation of models using TLM elements to separate model components makes them very suitable for computation in parallel because larger models can be partitioned into smaller independent submodels. The computation time can also be decreased by using small numerical solver step sizes only on those few submodels that need this for numerical stability. This is especially relevant for large and demanding models. In this paper we present work in how to combine TLM and solver inlining techniques in the Modelica equation-based language, giving the potential for efficient distributed simulation of model components over several processors.},

  abstract = {A fully functional meta-model co-simulation environment that supports integration of many different simulation tool specific models into a co-simulation is described in this paper. The continuously increasing performance of modern computer systems has a large influence on simulation technologies. It results in more and more detailed simulation models. Different simulation models typically focus on different parts (sub-systems) of the complete system, e.g., the gearbox of a car, the driveline, or even a single bearing inside the gearbox. To fully understand the complete system it is necessary to investigate several or all parts simultaneously. This is especially true for transient (dynamic) simulation models with several interconnected parts. One solution for a more complete and accurate system analysis is to couple different simulation models into one coherent simulation, also called a co-simulation. This also allows existing simulation models to be reused and preserves the investment in these models. Existing co-simulation applications are often capable of interconnecting two specific simulators where a unique interface between these tools is defined. However, a more general solution is needed to make co-simulation modelling applicable for a wider range of tools. Any such solution must also be numerically stable and easy to use in order to be functional for a larger group of people. The presented approach for mechanical system co-simulations is based upon a general framework for co-simulation and meta-modelling [9]. Several tool specific simulation models can be integrated and connected by means of a meta-model. A platform independent, centralised, meta-model simulator is presented that executes and monitors the co-simulation. All simulation tools that participate in the co-simulation implement a single, well defined, external interface that is based on a numerically stable method for force/moment interaction.},

Besides the simulator architecture, we detail our time synchronization approach, which is applied for interconnecting communication and power system simulation. Secondly, we present reference scenarios and configuration settings for the combined simulation system.
